# Order of tagsÂ¶
# The order of each tag metadata dictionary also defines the order shown in the docs UI.

You can configure the two documentation user interfaces included:

Swagger UI: served at /docs.
You can set its URL with the parameter docs_url.
You can disable it by setting docs_url=None.
ReDoc: served at /redoc.
You can set its URL with the parameter redoc_url.
You can disable it by setting redoc_url=None.
For example, to set Swagger UI to be served at /documentation and disable ReDoc:

"""Metadata for tags
Each dictionary can contain:

name (required): a str with the same tag name you use in the tags parameter in your path operations and APIRouters.
description: a str with a short description for the tag. It can have Markdown and will be shown in the docs UI.
externalDocs: a dict describing external documentation with:
    description: a str with a short description for the external docs.
    url (required): a str with the URL for the external documentation.
